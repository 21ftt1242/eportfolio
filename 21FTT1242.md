## 1. Setup
### 1.1 Creating SSH Key using terminal 

- Open terminal and create a .ssh folder
```sh
mkdir .ssh
```
- Go into the .ssh folder
```sh
cd .ssh
```
- Create an ed25519 encrytped key using student email as the comment:
```sh
> ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "21ftt1242@student.pb.edu.bn"
> File name: sop_as1
> Passphrase (Leave empty):
```
This will genereate two keys, one public and one private.
- Open the sop_as1.pub key to copy the public SSH key
```sh
> cat sop_as1.pub
```

### 1.2 Creating a Digital Ocean Droplet
1. Login to DigitalOcean using Github
2. Top right, Create Droplet (Green button)
3. Options:
    
    i) Region: `Singapore`
    
    ii) Image OS: `Ubuntu 22.04`
    
    iii) Droplet Type: `Basic plan`
    
    iv) CPU option: `Regular - Disk type: SSD`
    
    v) Pricing option: `$6/month (1GB /
1vCPU, 25GB SSD 1000GB Transfer)`
    
    vi) Choose Authentication Method: `SSH Key`
    
    vii) Add new SSH Key: `Paste the copied sop_as1.pub key and name it as` ***`sop_as1`***
    
    viii) Add Sir Bahit's SSH Key: `Copy and Paste Sir Bahit's SSH Key and 
    name it ` ***`sop_as1_sirbahit`***
   
    ix) Hostname: `sop-as1`

4. Create Droplet

5. VPS IP Address: `128.199.116.139`

---
## 2. Root Login using terminal
- Open the terminal and go into .ssh directory
```sh
> cd .ssh
```
This is necessary as the user must find the SSH key which is inside the .ssh directory.
- Type this into the terminal:
```sh
> ssh -i sop_as1 root@128.199.116.139
```
The ***`-i`*** means that the user can choose which SSH Key they want to log in with, in this case specifying the ***`sop_as1`*** as the key.
### 2.1 Make new non-root user
```
# adduser ftt1242
# password 21ftt1242
```
### 2.2 Grant Administrative Privileges (Sudo) for non-root user
```
# usermod -aG sudo ftt1242
```
### 2.3 Enabling external access for non-root user
```
# rsync --archive --chown=ftt1242:ftt1242 ~/.ssh /home/ftt1242
```
### 2.4 Setting up firewall
1. List installed UFW profiles
```
# ufw app list

Output
Available applications:
    OpenSSH
```
2. Allow SSH connections
```
# ufw allow OpenSSH
```
3. Enable Firewall
```
# ufw enable
```
4. Check firewall status
```
# ufw status

Status: active  
    To                Action      From  
    --                -----       ----  
    OpenSSH           ALLOW      Anywhere  
    OpenSSH (v6)      ALLOW      Anywhere
```
### 2.5 SSH Server Configuration
1. Open the sshd_config file
```
$ nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
2. Find and configure settings as such:

| No. | Conditions | New Changes
| ------ | ------ | ------- |
| 1 | Adding Custom port | Port `1242`
| 2 | Don't allow password auth | PasswordAuthentication `no`
| 3 | Allow public key auth | PubKeyAuthentication `yes`
| 4 | Don't allow root login | PermitRootLogin `no`
| 5 | Change maximum auth tries to 3 | MaxAuthTries `3`

Then close and save the edited config file using ***`CTRL + x`*** to exit and ***`y`*** to save changes.

3. Reload ssh service
```
$ sudo service ssh restart
```
### 2.6 Open Custom Port
```
$ sudo ufw status
$ sudo ufw allow 1242/tcp
```
This will now allow the non-root user to login using the custom port.
Now when entering as root, it will show the following message
```
root@128.199.116.139: Permission denied (publickey)
```
However, user `can actually change to root` **ONLY** when the non-root user is logged in by typing in the following command:
```
$ sudo -i
```
`Log entry date: 1st September 2023`
## 3. Create config file for shortcut
- Go inside the .ssh directory
```
cd .ssh
```
- Make a notepad file called config
```
> notepad config
```
It will then open the Notepad application. Inside of the config file is:
```
Host as1
    HostName 128.199.116.139
    User ftt1242
    Port 1242
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/sop_as1
```
- Save file and close
- Go to file explorer and search inside the .ssh folder
- The `config` file is currently a .txt file which can not be read by the terminal.
- On Windows, make it so that the file explorer can view File name extensions if haven't so.
- Rename `config.txt` to just `config`


## 4. Login as non-root user
On the terminal, there are two ways to login now. The first one is the original way, **assuming that the user is already inside the .ssh directory**:
```
ssh -i sop_as1 ftt1242@128.199.116.139 -p 1242
```
Adding to the command, **`-p 1242`** means that it will log in using the specified port.
And the second one is using the shortcut config file:
```
ssh as1
```

### 4.1 Install and enable Nginx Full
Since the assignment wants us to use only enable web traffic (port 80 & 443), Nginx Full will fulfill this requirement. The differences of other Nginx versions are:

`Nginx Full`: This profile opens both port 80 (normal, unencrypted web traffic) and port 443 (TLS/SSL encrypted traffic) 

`Nginx HTTP`: This profile opens only port 80 (normal, unencrypted web traffic) 

`Nginx HTTPS`: This profile opens only port 443 (TLS/SSL encrypted traffic)Apr 24, 2020

1. Update local package index and install Nginx Full
```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install nginx
```
2. Adjusting the firewall and allowing Nginx
```
$ sudo ufw app list

Output
Available applications:
    Nginx Full
    Nginx HTTp
    Nginx HTTPS
    OpenSSH
```
```
$ sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
$ sudo ufw status

Status: active  
To                 Action      From  
 --                 -----       ----  
1242/tcp            ALLOW       Anywhere  
OpenSSH             ALLOW       Anywhere
Nginx Full          ALLOW       Anywhere  
1242/tcp (v6)       ALLOW       Anywhere  
OpenSSH (v6)        ALLOW       Anywhere
Nginx Full (v6)     ALLOW       Anywhere 
```
3. Check if Nginx is running
```
$ systemctl status nginx
```
### 4.2 Setting up server blocks
1. Create directory for `site/domain`
```
$ sudo mkdir -p /var/www/ftt1242/html
```
2. Assign ownership of directory with `$USER` environment variable
```
$ sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/ftt1242/html
```
3. Set permissions (Able to read, write and execute)
```
$ sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/ftt1242
```
4. Create index.html file using nano and paste according to Assignment Brief
```
$ nano /var/www/ftt1242/html/index.html

<!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>SysOps Assignment 1</title>
</head>
<body>
    Welcome to my website on my VPS on the cloud! 
    <br>
    My ID is 21FTT1242
</body>
</html>
```
Save and close by pressing **`CTRL + x`** to exit and **`y`** to save.

5. Create server block to serve content of index.html
```
$ sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/ftt1242
server {  
        listen 80;  
        listen [::]:80;  

        root /var/www/ftt1242/html;  
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;  

        server_name ftt1242 128.199.116.139  

        location / {  
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;  
        }  
}  
```
Save and close by pressing **`CTRL + x`** to exit and **`y`** to save.

6. Enabling file by creating a link to the sites-enable directory for Nginx to read
```
$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/ftt1242 /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ 
```
Save and close by pressing **`CTRL + x`** to exit and **`y`** to save.

7. Adjust single value in Nginx config file to avoid possible has bucket memory problem
```
$ sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```
```
...
http {
    ...
    server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;
    ...
}
...
```
Save and close by pressing **`CTRL + x`** to exit and **`y`** to save.

8. Test to make sure there are no syntax error in Nginx files
```
$ sudo nginx -t
```
9. Restart Nginx to enable changes
```
$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

Now when visiting http://128.199.116.139/ , user should be greeted with the predefined welcome HTML file.

### 4.3 Changing Timezone
1. Check system's current timezone
```
$ timedatectl

Local time: Sun 2023-08-27 21:19:45 UTC
           Universal time: Sun 2023-08-27 21:19:45 UTC
                 RTC time: Sun 2023-08-27 21:19:45
                Time zone: Etc/UTC (UTC, +0000)
System clock synchronized: yes
              NTP service: active
          RTC in local TZ: no
```
2. Check list of timezones in Asia
```
$ timedatectl list-timezones | grep Asia
```
3. Set timezone to Singapore
```
sudo timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Singapore
```
2. Verify the changes by checking the timezone
```
$ timedatectl

Local time: Sun 2023-09-01 17:20:01 +08
           Universal time: Sun 2023-08-27 17:20:01 UTC
                 RTC time: Sun 2023-08-27 17:20:01
                Time zone: Asia/Singapore (+08, +0800)
System clock synchronized: yes
              NTP service: active
          RTC in local TZ: no
```
